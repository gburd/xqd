Managing DB's limitations:

DB is wonderful, but sometimes a bit unforgiving. For
a server designed to run 24x7x365 there has to be some
sort of strategy to manage this.

Examples include:
* mutex and lock region allocation
  * how to size them at startup?
  * how to manage issues when they run out
* other unchangable aspects of DB at runtime
* issues related to failchk()

Strategy:
Run two processes in HA mode, each as master.
When some condition arises that reqiures a complete
process shutdown/restart spawn a third master, then
shut down one of the three and bring it up with the
new config.  Do that to one of the other two processes
as well.  Shut down the third process.  Now you have
two live DB database environemnts with new configurations
and things should be good.  There should have been no
downtime/interruption at all.
